# IdeaFlow

IdeaFlow is a clean, responsive idea-management board where users can add ideas, organize them across columns using drag-and-drop, search through them instantly, and have everything saved in localStorage.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, this project focuses on DOM manipulation, rendering logic, interactivity, and UI/UX enhancements.
